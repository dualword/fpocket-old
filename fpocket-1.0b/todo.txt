This is a TODO text file for the developers of fpocket. Here current development 
aims of the group can be seen. If you have ideas of how to design fpocket in a 
more convenient way for you, just drop us a line.


    Priority        Todo
    --------------------

Code
    high            > Complete comments
					> Adapt dpocket and tpocket to be able to design correct  
					  statistics if the ligand appears multiple times
					> Give the possibility to keep fpocket output when running
					  tpocket
					> Make the code as sexy as possible!!
					 
	low				> Satisfy g++ compilation requirement
					> Performance issues : implement the index neighbour lists 
					  everywhere we can
					> Performance issues : Remove the memory handler, find another
					  solution.
				
documentation
	high			> Retrieve and complete manuals.
					> Propose a full PDF documentation giving installation
					  instructions and examples of usage.

	medium			> Include in the documentation an example showing how to
					  modify the scoring function & the way fpocket sort pockets

        medium                  > Include in the documentation an example showing how to add a new descriptor

qhull    
    high            > Erase voronoi tmp files after use, or don't even use it.

    medium          > Assess limits of qhull (maximum number of points) -> enhance 
					  error management
					> Use qhull as static library object in order to provide 
					  bigger portability of fpocket (contact the qhull team)

input
    medium          > Enable input of "to keep" HETATM tags by command line

output
    medium          > Give the possibility to define the output path through 
					  command line, keeping the current behaviour as default

visualization
    low             > Write a tcl based gui frontend for viewing and navigating 
					  through results using VMD
    medium          > Enhance PYMOL vizualisation output
