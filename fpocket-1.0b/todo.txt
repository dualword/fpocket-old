This is a TODO text file for the developers of fpocket. Here current development 
aims of the group can be seen. If you have ideas of how to design fpocket in a 
more convenient way for you, just drop us a line.


    Priority        Todo
    --------------------

Code
    high            > Complete comments

					  statistics if the ligand appears multiple times
					> Give the possibility to keep fpocket output when running

					> Make the code as sexy as possible!!
					 
	low				> Satisfy g++ compilation requirement

qhull    
    high            > Erase voronoi tmp files after use, or don't even use it.

    medium          > Assess limits of qhull (maximum number of points) -> enhance 
					  error management

input
    medium          > Enable input of "to keep" HETATM tags by command line

output
    medium          > Give the possibility to define the output path through

					  through results using VMD
    medium          > Enhance PYMOL vizualisation output
