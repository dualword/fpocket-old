more convenient way for you, just drop us a line.


    Priority        Todo
    --------------------
fpocket
    high            adapt dpocket and tpocket to be able to design correct statistics if the ligand appears multiple times
    low             performance issues : implement the index neighbour lists everywhere we can

qhull    
    low             use qhull as static library object in order to provide bigger portability of fpocket (contact the qhull team)
