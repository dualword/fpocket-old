This is a TODO text file for the developers of fpocket. Here current development 
aims of the group can be seen. If you have ideas of how to design fpocket in a 
more convenient way for you, just drop us a line.


    Priority        Todo
    --------------------

Code
    high            > Adapt dpocket and tpocket to be able to design correct  
					  statistics if the ligand appears multiple times
		    > Correct Usage printing (with the def. parameters printed using the params defined in the fparams.h file). 
		    > Explicit in usage what the explite pocket def 1 and 2 are.
		    > rpdb.c does not work on proteins with no element name in the end of an atom line....-> debug this
					 
	low				> Satisfy g++ compilation requirement
					> Performance issues : implement the index neighbour lists 
					  everywhere we can
					> Performance issues : Remove the memory handler, find another
					  solution.
				
documentation
	high			> Retrieve and complete manuals.
					> Propose a full PDF documentation giving installation
					  instructions and examples of usage.

	medium			> Include in the documentation an example showing how to
					  modify the scoring function & the way fpocket sort pockets

    medium          > Include in the documentation an example showing how to add a new descriptor

qhull    
    high            > Erase voronoi tmp files after use, or don't even use it.

    medium          > Assess limits of qhull (maximum number of points) -> enhance 
					  error management
					> Use qhull as static library object in order to provide 
					  bigger portability of fpocket (contact the qhull team)

input
    high            > Test parameters options of fpocket, dpocket, tpocket in
                      each files to avoid warning message "unknown option"
		    > Test ranges of parameters on input. For instance -m < -M, or -A between 0 and 4 etc....

    medium          > Enable input of "to keep" HETATM tags by command line

output
    high            > Handle error when the input file of fpocket is in the
                      current directory.
    medium          > Give the possibility to define the output path through 
					  command line, keeping the current behaviour as default

visualization
    low             > Write a tcl based gui frontend for viewing and navigating 
					  through results using VMD
    medium          > Enhance PYMOL vizualisation output

debugging
    high            > Create a template bugreport.txt file for eventual bug reports from users.
