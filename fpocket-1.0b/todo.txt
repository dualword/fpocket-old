This is a TODO text file for the developers of fpocket. Here current development 
aims of the group can be seen. If you have ideas of how to design fpocket in a 
more convenient way for you, just drop us a line.


    Priority        Todo
    --------------------

Code
    high    > Adapt dpocket and tpocket to be able to design correct
			  statistics if the ligand appears multiple times 
		    > rpdb.c does not work on proteins with no element name in the end of an atom line....-> debug this
            > Don't take into account hydrogens when defining the pocket using
              the simple distance criteria (ligand's neighbor)

	low		> Performance issues : implement the index neighbour lists 
			  everywhere we can
			> Performance issues : Remove the memory handler, find another
			  solution.
				
documentation
	high	> Check GNU manuals (namely default parameters)
			> Propose a full PDF documentation giving installation
			  instructions, examples of usage, descriptor definition and scoring
              function modification.


qhull    
    high    > Erase voronoi tmp files after use, or don't even use it.

    medium  > Assess limits of qhull (maximum number of points) -> enhance 
			  error management

input
    high    > Test ranges of parameters on input. For instance -m < -M, or
              A between 0 and 4 etc....

    low     > Enable input of "to keep" HETATM tags by command line

output
    high    > Handle error when the input file of fpocket is in the
              current directory.
    medium  > Give the possibility to define the output path through 
			  command line, keeping the current behaviour as default

visualization
    low     > Write a tcl based gui frontend for viewing and navigating 
			  through results using VMD
